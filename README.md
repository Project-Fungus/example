## Re-Running the Scraper

The projects in this repository are scraped from [RosettaCode.org](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code). The following procedure is only necessary if you want to re-run the scraper.

1. If you do not yet have a virtual environment, create one using `python -m venv .venv`.
2. Activate the virtual environment using `.venv/Scripts/activate`.
3. Install the dependencies using `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the scraper using `python scrape.py`.
